          <li>The Utah Reference Network GPS (TURN GPS) is a cooperative effort involving many partners with the Utah Geospatial Resource Center (UGRC). This collaborative partnership has made it possible to deliver services at a relatively low cost to users. The partners and the UGRC are committed to delivery of reliable services through TURN GPS. However, some GPS reference stations are located in partnering agencies facilities that may only be accessible during regular business hours. The user understands and acknowledges that this will limit UGRC&apos;s ability to immediately address problems at these facilities outside of regular business hours. Users of this service understand and acknowledge that support for connecting devices will not be provided by the UGRC. Users should seek this support from their local vendors.</li>
          <li>Users of this service are responsible for verifying the accuracy of the data logged by their device for their own work.
